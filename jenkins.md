# Jenkins
## Suites

I added the BDD and unit test suits to my personal Jenkins, and so this project can be added to a CI/CD pipeline. You can see it running here as ECS jobs:

* [BDD suite](http://host.3sds.co.uk:8080/job/ECS%20BDD%20suite/)
* [Unit tests (basket)](http://host.3sds.co.uk:8080/job/ECS%20unit%20tests%20-%20basket/)
* [Unit tests (discounts)](http://host.3sds.co.uk:8080/job/ECS%20unit%20tests%20-%20discounts/)
* [Example usage](http://host.3sds.co.uk:8080/job/ECS%20example-usage/)

## Credentials

`https://host.3sds.co.uk:8080`

`username: admin`

`password: kDFmL?z2%,'CPjAy`

## Note

Please note there are other personal project on this system, please only access the ecs.co.uk project :)
I'll change the password in a couple of days. Its not a critical system though, I do not as a rule share admin passwords.
