# Jenkins
## Suites

I added the BDD and unit test suits to my personal Jenkins, and so this project can be added to a CI/CD pipeline. You can see it running here as ECS jobs:

* [BDD suite](http://host.3sds.co.uk:8080/job/ECS%20BDD%20suite/)
* [Unit tests (basket)](http://host.3sds.co.uk:8080/job/ECS%20unit%20tests%20-%20basket/)
* [Unit tests (discounts)](http://host.3sds.co.uk:8080/job/ECS%20unit%20tests%20-%20discounts/)
* [Example usage](http://host.3sds.co.uk:8080/job/ECS%20example-usage/)
