# Jenkins
I add the BDD and unit test suits to my personal Jenkins, and so this project can be added to a CI/CD pipeline. You can see it running here as ECS jobs:

https://host.3sds.co.uk:8080
username: admin
password: kDFmL?z2%,'CPjAy

Please note there are other personal project on this system, please only access the ecs.co.uk project :)
I'll change the password in a couple of days. Its not a critical system though, I do not as a rule share admin passwords.
